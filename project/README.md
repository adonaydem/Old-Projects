I am Adonay Gebremedhin and this is my first CS50 project. In this project, I have tried to draw upon the experiences I have gained from the 11 weeks of CS50x lectures and problems.

This project is inspired by my sister's pharmacy situated in my home country, Ethiopia. I wanted to use this opportunity to help my family and my community in their day-to-day activities. I think this type of application, although common, is still unutilized and unacknowledged in third world communities like mine. I wanted to contribute something in the area of digitalization of the still numerous paper-based systems in my community.

This web application contains various platforms that will enable a certain pharmacy to automate its processes. It provides five basic uses: Administration, Human Resources Management, Logistics Management, Account/Finance Management and Sales and Point of Sale.

The Human Resources Management platform enables an HR manager to gather the entire employee experience. The manager has the capability to hire and hire employees. He/She has complete access to the employeeâ€™s data. He/She can add supplier information and has control over salary system. The Logistics Management platform enables a logistics officer to implement the entire inventory management of a pharmacy. The officer has the capability to add new products in the market as well as refilling stocks that are depleted. The Account Management platform enables the user to oversee account and transaction histories of the business. He/She has also the ability to deposit and withdraw money from the business account for variety of reason. Finally, the POS (Point of Sale) platform is where the real action happens. Accountant or Pharmacists have the ability to search for products and perform a purchase for a certain customer. It has an efficient shopping cart system to implement the aforementioned task.

The Administration system allows the Administrator to oversee each of the above-mentioned divisions. The application gives the admin access to every platform mentioned above. In addition, it gives the Administrator the ability to hire/fire higher managers, as well as ordinary employees. It also gives a unique platform that enables the admin to generate reports between specified periods. It shows Total sales, Profit, and profit by product, Best Selling and Worst Selling Products, best performing Sales employee.

In conclusion, I have used Python, SQL and JavaScript to implement the web application for the CS50x project. The application enables a certain pharmacy to automate its day-to-day performances, and creates a paperless environment. It includes finance, HR and inventory management systems, with a well-designed hierarchy.
